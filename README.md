An rsync-based backup tool for nomadic setups where sources and destinations aren't always available — laptops on the move, removable drives, 
home servers behind changing networks. 

Sentinel files ensure backups only run when volumes are genuinely present, with optional btrfs or hard-link snapshots for point-in-time recovery.

## Main Use Cases

The tool is primarily designed for the following backup scenarios:
- **Laptop to Server** — back up to your home server whenever you're on the home network
- **Laptop to External Drive** — back up to an external drive whenever it's connected
- **External Drive to Server** — replicate an external drive to your home server when both are available
- **Server to External Drive** — back up your home server to an external drive
- **Easy Setup** - pilot the backups from your laptop, minimal setup on the server (`rsync`, `btrfs`)

It replaces the rsync shell scripts you'd normally maintain, adding:
- **Volume detection** (through sentinel files) — only runs when sources and destinations are actually available
- **Btrfs and hard-link snapshots** — keeps point-in-time copies so a bad sync can't wipe good backups
- **Declarative config** — one YAML file describes all your backup pairs
- **Structured output** — human-readable for convenience and JSON output for scripting and automation

## Non-Goals

nbkp is designed around a single orchestrator (typically a laptop) that initiates all syncs. 
It intentionally does not support multi-server topologies where data flows directly between remote servers, for several reasons:

- **SSH credentials are local.** Keys, proxy-jump chains, and connection options in the config describe how the orchestrator reaches each server — not how servers reach each other. Forwarding credentials between servers adds security risk and configuration complexity.
- **Checks and transfers take different paths.** Pre-flight checks (sentinel files, rsync availability, btrfs detection) run from the orchestrator to each server independently, but a server-to-server transfer would bypass the orchestrator entirely — meaning checks can pass while the actual sync fails.
- **Post-sync operations (snapshots, pruning) assume orchestrator access.** Btrfs and hard-link snapshot management connects from the orchestrator to the destination, not from the source server.

If you need server-to-server replication:
- **Install nbkp on one of the servers** and configure separate syncs from there, treating that server as the orchestrator.
- **Use tools designed for multi-server topologies**: check the [Similar Tools](#similar-tools) section for options that support enterpris-y / multi-host setups.

## Philosophy

**Design Principles**
- Laptop-centric workflows
- Changing networks
- Drives being plugged/unplugged
- Backups happening when possible
- Not always-on infrastructure
- Personal homelab / Raspberry Pi setups

**Implementation Principles**

No custom storage format, protocol, or encryption — just proven tools composed together:
- **rsync + SSH** — handles the actual file transfer, locally or remotely
- **Plain directories** — files are stored as-is; restoring is just a copy
- **Btrfs snapshots (optional)** — space-efficient point-in-time copies via copy-on-write, with automatic pruning. Each snapshot is a read-only subvolume exposing a plain directory tree
- **Hard-link snapshots (optional)** — alternative to btrfs snapshots, works on any filesystem that supports hard links, but less efficient and more fragile
- **cryptsetup (optional)** — full-volume encryption for backup destinations

**Nomad backup metaphor**

A nomad:
- Moves between places
- Sets up temporary camp
- Carries essential belongings
- Adapts to environment
- Relies on what is present

Which maps to:
- Laptop
- External drive
- Home server
- Network availability
- Mount detection

### Similar Tools

There are a number of open source backup tools that use rsync, btrfs, or similar principles. This section describes how `nbkp` compares to some of the popular ones.
If you believe that the representation is inaccurate or if there are other tools that should be included in this list, please submit an issue or PR to update this section.

#### Rsync-based

- **[rsnapshot](https://rsnapshot.org/)** — periodic snapshots via rsync + hard links (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly). Designed for server/cron use with no awareness of removable or intermittent targets. Files stored as plain directories.
- **[Back In Time](https://github.com/bit-team/backintime)** — GUI/CLI tool using rsync + hard links with scheduling and encfs encryption. Provides a Qt interface; uses hard links instead of btrfs snapshots; no sentinel-file mechanism for removable drives.
- **[rsync-time-backup](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup)** — Time Machine-style shell script using rsync `--link-dest`. Single script, no config file; uses hard links instead of btrfs snapshots; no volume detection.
- **[rdiff-backup](https://rdiff-backup.net/)** — keeps the latest backup as a plain mirror, stores reverse diffs for older versions. Older versions require the tool to reconstruct; no removable-drive awareness.
- **[Dirvish](https://dirvish.org/)** — rotating network backup system using rsync + hard links. Oriented toward server-pull workflows; no removable-drive detection or btrfs support.

#### Deduplicating

- **[BorgBackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/)** — chunk-level deduplication with compression and authenticated encryption. Proprietary repository format (not plain directories); requires `borg` on the remote side; no removable-drive detection.
- **[Restic](https://restic.net/)** — content-addressable backups with encryption by default, supporting many backends (local, S3, SFTP, B2). Proprietary format; restoring requires the restic tool; no volume detection.
- **[Duplicity](https://duplicity.us/)** — GPG-encrypted tar volumes with librsync incremental transfers. Not browsable as plain directories; full+incremental chain model; no btrfs integration.
- **[Kopia](https://kopia.io/)** — content-addressable storage with encryption, compression, and both CLI/GUI. Proprietary format; includes an optional scheduling server; no removable-drive or btrfs support.

#### Btrfs / snapshot-focused

- **[btrbk](https://github.com/digint/btrbk)** — btrfs-native snapshot management with send/receive for remote transfers. Btrfs-only (no rsync); more sophisticated retention policies (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly); no non-btrfs filesystem support.
- **[Snapper](http://snapper.io/)** — automated btrfs snapshot creation with timeline-based retention and rollback. Local snapshot management only; no rsync or remote transfer; no external backup targets.
- **[Timeshift](https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift)** — system restore via rsync + hard links or btrfs snapshots. Targets root filesystem for system-level rollback; excludes user data by default; no remote backup.

#### Continuous / real-time

- **[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)** — continuous peer-to-peer file synchronization across devices. Decentralized (no central server); syncs bidirectionally in real time; no snapshots or point-in-time recovery; designed for keeping folders in sync rather than creating backups.
- **[Lsyncd](https://lsyncd.github.io/lsyncd/)** — monitors directories via inotify and triggers rsync (or other tools) on changes. Daemon-based, continuous replication; designed for server-to-server mirroring; no snapshot management or removable-drive awareness.

#### Cloud / multi-backend

- **[Rclone](https://rclone.org/)** — syncs files to and between 70+ cloud and remote backends (S3, SFTP, Google Drive, etc.). Can transfer server-to-server directly; not rsync-based; no btrfs integration or volume detection.

#### Bidirectional sync

- **[Unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison)** — bidirectional file synchronization between two hosts. Detects conflicts; requires Unison on both sides with matching versions; no snapshots or removable-drive awareness.

#### Enterprise / multi-host

- **[Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/) / [Bareos](https://www.bareos.com/)** — enterprise client-server backup with a director, storage daemons, and file daemons across multiple hosts. Full multi-server topology; proprietary catalog and storage format; significant setup complexity.
- **[Amanda](https://www.amanda.org/)** — network backup orchestrating multiple clients from a central server. Designed for tape and disk pools; uses native dump/tar; heavier infrastructure than nbkp targets.
