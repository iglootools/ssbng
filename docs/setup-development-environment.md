# Setup Development Environment

1. [Install and activate mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html)

2. Install Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine on Linux)

3. Configure github CLI with `gh auth login` and ensure you have access to the repository (optional, for convenience).

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # - Install all the tools defined in mise.toml
   # - Set up the .venv with the correct Python version
   mise install

   # vscode and poetry should automatically detect and use the .venv created by mise
   poetry install

   # To recreate the virtualenv from scratch:
   poetry env remove --all
   ```
