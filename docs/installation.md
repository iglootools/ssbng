# Installation

## Install with pipx

[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) installs CLI tools in isolated environments, keeping your system Python clean:

```bash
pipx install nbkp
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
pipx upgrade nbkp
```

## Shell Completion

nbkp supports tab completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.

Install completion for your current shell:

```bash
nbkp --install-completion
```

Or target a specific shell:

```bash
nbkp --install-completion bash
nbkp --install-completion zsh
nbkp --install-completion fish
nbkp --install-completion powershell
```

To preview the completion script without installing it:

```bash
nbkp --show-completion
```

Restart your shell (or source the relevant config file) for completions to take effect.
